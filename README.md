### Hello,

This is my repository for an assortment of random projects (majority in python currently) that I have done. I do not expect the code to be of the best quality and in most cases are broken since I do not have a habit of noting down the packages that I use for the code. Maybe some day there will be more content added here than a readme file, but I guess we'll see about that.
