### Hello,

This is my repository for an assortment of random projects that I have done and decided to make public. Do not expect the code to be of the best quality; in fact in most cases they are broken since I do not have a habit of noting down the packages that I used for the code. Maybe some day there will be more content added here than a readme file, but I guess we'll see about that.
